# Responsive-dashboard
The project aims to design and build a responsive dashboard layout using Tailwind CSS and Handlebars.js.The layout is composed of three key sections
— the sidebar, the header, and the main content area.

The sidebar serves as a navigation panel that includes links to different
sections such as Dashboard, Calendar, Tasks, Messages, Settings, and Profile.
Each link is represented with an SVG icon, and the sidebar is designed to
remain visible on larger screens. On mobile devices, it collapses into a
hamburger menu, maintaining usability while saving screen space.

The header (navbar) contains a search bar, notification icon, and user avatar.
It remains fixed at the top, providing quick access to important functions.

The main content area displays summary cards, charts, and recent activities.
The cards dynamically show key metrics such as total users, revenue, new
orders, and page views. Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities ensure that these
elements adjust automatically based on the screen size.
Overall, the design focuses on simplicity, readability, and smooth navigation —
essential qualities for any professional dashboard interface.
